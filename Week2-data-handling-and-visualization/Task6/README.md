# Task 6: Titanic Dataset EDA

## Dataset Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset. The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographics, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Go to Google Colab (colab.research.google.com)
2. Click "Upload" and select the `titanic_eda.ipynb` file
3. Run the notebook cell by cell or click "Runtime" → "Run all"

## Key Findings
- Women had significantly higher survival rates than men (chivalry principle)
- Higher social class correlated with higher survival rates
- Age and family size also appear to influence survival chances
- Passengers who paid higher fares (typically higher class) had better survival odds

## Analysis Steps Performed
1. Data loading and initial exploration
2. Missing value identification and handling
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing
4. Univariate and bivariate analysis
5. Visualization of key relationships
6. Derivation of insights and conclusions
