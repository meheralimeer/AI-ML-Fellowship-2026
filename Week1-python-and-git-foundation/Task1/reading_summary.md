# Summary of Difference between AI, ML, DL and Data Science
## AI vs. ML vs. DL
Although AL, ML and DL sound like different names of the same things, but they are actually pretty apart from each other. By definitions:
### AI
AI is a branch of Computer Science that deals with machines able to learn, reason, make descisions and perform human-like actions.
### ML
ML is a subset of AI, it includes statistical algorithms used in AI to detect patterns in the data and learn from it.
### DL
DL is also a subset of Ai, but unlike ML, DL took an approach similar to Biology to train the machine. It contains complex neural networks similar to how our brains work usign neurons.
## Data Science
Data Science is a field, as the name applies, that deals with data. It focuses on actions like analyzing data to extract information using statistical or programming approaches.
