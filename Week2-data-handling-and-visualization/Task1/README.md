# Week 2 Task: Titanic Dataset EDA

## Dataset Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset. The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographics, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```
2. Clone this repository
3. Navigate to the Week2-data-handling-and-visualization/Task1 directory
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook titanic_eda.ipynb
   ```

## Key Findings
- Women had significantly higher survival rates than men (chivalry principle)
- Higher social class correlated with higher survival rates
- Age and family size also appear to influence survival chances
- Passengers who paid higher fares (typically higher class) had better survival odds

## Analysis Steps Performed
1. Data loading and initial exploration
2. Missing value identification and handling
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing
4. Univariate and bivariate analysis
5. Visualization of key relationships
6. Derivation of insights and conclusions
